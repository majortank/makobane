# Ma'Kobane: A Collaborative Sotho to English Dictionary App

## Description

Ma'Kobane is an open-source project dedicated to creating a comprehensive and collaborative Sotho to English dictionary application. The project aims to preserve and promote the Sotho language, an integral part of the cultural heritage of the Basotho people.

The dictionary app is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, catering to both language learners and native Sotho speakers. By leveraging community participation and input, Ma'Kobane will evolve into a dynamic, living resource that extends beyond the traditional dictionary format.

## Key Features

- **Collaborative Entry Curation**: Users can contribute new words, definitions, and examples, with a community voting system ensuring quality and accuracy.
- **Versatile Search and Lookup**: Offers stem-based and full-word search options, including a "fuzzy search" feature to account for common spelling variations.
- **Comprehensive Entry Display**: Main entries appear in bold, derived forms in italics, and symbols indicate inflections, alternative forms, and points of junction.
- **Multimedia Integration**: Includes audio pronunciations and usage examples from literature or user submissions.
- **Cultural Context**: Features cultural notes, explanations, and links to related proverbs, idioms, or sayings.
- **Accessibility Features**: Supports text-to-speech for both Sotho and English, optimized for users with visual impairments.
